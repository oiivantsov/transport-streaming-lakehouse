# Results (TBD)

This section is a **work in progress**. The plan is to run the HSL pipeline in full mode for some time to collect and analyze a large-scale dataset (up to 1M events).  

## Key Metrics (Expected)

* **Active buses in traffic (concurrent)**  
  - Minimum observed: ~500  
  - Maximum observed: ~900  
  - Typical range varies throughout the day  

* **Route-level insights**  
  - **Most delayed routes** → ranked by % of late arrivals  
  - **Most punctual routes** → ranked by % of on-time arrivals  
  - **Most popular routes** → by average number of buses active every 30 minutes  

* **Delay distribution** (across all events):  
  - Delay ≤ 1 min → ~40% of buses  
  - Delay ≤ 2 min → ~70% of buses  
  - Delay ≤ 3 min → ~90% of buses
